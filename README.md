This is a term project for NLP where ML and NLP tools are applied to identify the correct languages.

In this project we have preprocessed multiple data sets downloaded from various sources(check report file for detail about data sets used). The datasets were merged together and created a final data set to apply various Classical ML Models and a Neural Network Model. The results were beyond our expection each models were able to give us accuracy above 90% with highest average accuracy of 99% for MNB model.

Classical Models

Multinomial Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine
Neural Network

RNN LSTM model
Experimental methodology and results are written in project report.
